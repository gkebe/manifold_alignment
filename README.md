# Manifold Alignment for GoLD Dataset

## Approach

"A cross-modality manifold alignment procedure that leverages triplet loss to jointly learn consistent, multi-modal embeddings of language-based concepts
of real-world items." [[1]](#1).

## Dataset

The **G**r**o**unded **L**anguage **D**ataset, or GoLD, is a grounded language learning dataset in five modalities: RGB, depth, text and speech. The data contains 207 instances of 47 object classes. The objects are from five high level categories of _food_, _home_, _medical_, _office_, and _tool_. Each instance is captured from different angles for a total of 825 images. Text and speech descriptions are collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for a total of 16500 text descriptions and 16500 speech descriptions.

The dataset is available [here](https://github.com/iral-lab/gold/edit/main/README.md).
